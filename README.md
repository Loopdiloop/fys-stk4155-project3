# fys-stk4155-project3
The third project in the machine learning project at UiO, looking at nuclear physics evaluations of nuclei.

As input, there is a file needed to run properly as the file is way too big to add in a normal Github repo. There is a link for download it in the pdf.

This project is severely lacking, though it has a very nice scraping algorithm for nuclear half lives.
